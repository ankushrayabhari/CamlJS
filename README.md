# CamlJS

## Generate the Source Files
Before running tests or building the executable, the autogenerated source files
must be generated. To do this, run ```make grammar```.

## Building and Running the Transpiler
Running ``` make ``` will generate an executable named ```camljs```.
To compile a file, run:
```
./camljs [input source file] [output js file path]
```

## Running Tests
Running ``` make test ``` will run the unit test suite. The standard OCaml
installation of all assignments is required.

## Running End to End Tests
Running ``` make e2e-test ``` will run the end to end test suite.
Note that you must be on MacOS and have a recent version of NodeJS
(with an executable named ```node``` located in your PATH) and an OCaml runtime
(with an executable named ```ocaml``` located in your PATH) in order to execute
the test suite.

## Generating Docs
Running ``` make docs ``` will generate the documentation in a folder called
```doc.private``` and ```doc.public``` folders.
