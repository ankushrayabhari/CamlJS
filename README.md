# CamlJS
An OCaml to JS transpiler, complete with an LR(1) parser generator.

## Requirements
This project was built with OCaml version 4.06.1 and OUnit 2.0.8.
You must be running on a UNIX OS and have executables named ```node```
and ```ocaml``` located in your PATH to run the E2E tests.

## Building and Running the Transpiler
Running ``` make ``` will generate an executable named ```camljs```.
This might take a while on your first time as the grammar needs to be converted
to autogenerated source files.
To compile a file, run:
```
./camljs [input source file] [output js file path]
```

## Running Tests
Running ``` make test ``` will run the unit test suite.

## Running End to End Tests
Running ``` make e2e-test ``` will run the end to end test suite.

## Generating Docs
Running ``` make docs ``` will generate the documentation in the
folders ``` doc.private ``` and ``` doc.public ```.

## Making the LR(1) Parser Generator
For converting your own grammars to parse trees, update ```grammar.json``` and
run ```make grammar```. This will run the converter script and generate the
necessary source files in ```parser/```.
